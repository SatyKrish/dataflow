# LLM-Based Agent Architecture

## Overview

This document explains the enhanced agent architecture where all agents use Large Language Models (LLMs) for intelligent reasoning, planning, and decision-making. This transforms them from simple tools/libraries into true **intelligent agents**.

## Core Principle: Agent vs Tool/Library

### What Makes an Agent vs Tool/Library?

| Aspect | Tool/Library | Agent |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| **Decision Making** | Follows predefined logic | Uses LLM to reason and decide |
| **Adaptability** | Fixed behavior | Adapts approach based on context |
| **Problem Solving** | Executes predetermined steps | Plans and strategizes dynamically |
| **Error Handling** | Basic fallbacks | Intelligent recovery and adaptation |
| **Learning** | Static behavior | Learns from context and feedback |

### Why This Matters

Before the LLM enhancement, our agents were essentially sophisticated tools that:
- Made hardcoded calls to data sources
- Followed predetermined validation logic
- Provided basic aggregation without insight

Now they are true agents that:
- **Reason** about the best approach for each task
- **Plan** multi-step strategies dynamically
- **Adapt** their methods based on context and results
- **Learn** from outcomes to improve decisions

## Enhanced Agent Architecture

### 1. MetadataAgent - Intelligent Discovery Strategist

**Before (Tool-like):**
```python
# Hardcoded approach
def discover_metadata():
    call_denodo()
    return basic_schema_info()
```

**After (Agent-like):**
```python
# LLM-driven reasoning
async def _execute_logic(self, task, context):
    # 1. LLM analyzes task and creates discovery strategy
    strategy = await self._llm_create_discovery_strategy(task, context)
    
    # 2. LLM selects optimal discovery methods
    methods = await self._llm_select_discovery_methods(strategy, task, context)
    
    # 3. Execute with intelligent adaptation
    results = await self._execute_discovery_methods(methods, strategy, context)
    
    # 4. LLM synthesizes findings into actionable insights
    synthesis = await self._llm_synthesize_metadata(results, task, context)
    
    # 5. LLM generates strategic recommendations
    recommendations = await self._llm_generate_recommendations(synthesis, task, context)
```

**Key LLM-Driven Capabilities:**
- **Strategic Planning**: Creates tailored discovery strategies based on task requirements
- **Method Selection**: Chooses optimal discovery approaches (Denodo, filesystem, APIs, etc.)
- **Adaptive Execution**: Can stop early if sufficient metadata discovered
- **Intelligent Synthesis**: Connects metadata findings to business context
- **Risk Assessment**: Identifies data quality and access risks

### 2. EntitlementAgent - Security Reasoning Specialist

**Before (Tool-like):**
```python
# Simple validation
def validate_access():
    if user_has_permission():
        return "granted"
    return "denied"
```

**After (Agent-like):**
```python
# Comprehensive security reasoning
async def _execute_logic(self, task, context):
    # 1. LLM analyzes security implications
    security_analysis = await self._llm_analyze_security_implications(task, context)
    
    # 2. LLM determines compliance requirements
    compliance_analysis = await self._llm_analyze_compliance_requirements(security_analysis, task, context)
    
    # 3. LLM selects security frameworks
    framework_selection = await self._llm_select_security_frameworks(security_analysis, compliance_analysis, context)
    
    # 4. LLM performs risk assessment
    risk_assessment = await self._llm_perform_risk_assessment(security_analysis, compliance_analysis, context)
    
    # 5. LLM makes access control decision
    access_decision = await self._llm_make_access_decision(security_analysis, compliance_analysis, risk_assessment, context)
    
    # 6. LLM generates security recommendations
    security_recommendations = await self._llm_generate_security_recommendations(access_decision, risk_assessment, context)
```

**Key LLM-Driven Capabilities:**

- **Intelligent Decisions**: Context-aware access control with conditions and monitoring

### 3. DataAgent - Intelligent Tool Orchestrator

**Before (Tool-like):**
```python
# Hardcoded calls
def get_data():
    call_denodo()
    call_demo_endpoint()
    return raw_results()
```

**After (Agent-like):**
```python
# Intelligent tool selection and orchestration
async def _execute_logic(self, task, context):
    # 1. LLM analyzes task requirements
    task_analysis = await self._llm_analyze_task_requirements(task, context)
    
    # 2. LLM discovers and evaluates available tools
    tool_discovery = await self._discover_available_tools()
    
    # 3. LLM selects optimal tools for the task
    tool_selection = await self._llm_select_tools(task_analysis, tool_discovery, context)
    
    # 4. Execute tools with intelligent orchestration
    execution_results = await self._execute_selected_tools(tool_selection, task_analysis, context)
    
    # 5. LLM analyzes and synthesizes results
    result_analysis = await self._llm_analyze_results(execution_results, task, context)
```

**Key LLM-Driven Capabilities:**
- **Dynamic Tool Discovery**: Loads tools from MCP configuration dynamically

- **Adaptive Execution**: Can retry, fallback, or change approach based on results
- **Result Synthesis**: Combines data from multiple sources intelligently

### 4. AggregationAgent - Strategic Data Analyst

**Before (Tool-like):**
```python
# Basic aggregation
def aggregate():
    combine_results()
    return summary()
```

**After (Agent-like):**
```python
# Comprehensive analytical reasoning
async def _execute_logic(self, task, context):
    # 1. LLM creates aggregation strategy
    strategy = await self._llm_create_aggregation_strategy(task, context)
    
    # 2. LLM selects analytical frameworks
    frameworks = await self._llm_select_analysis_frameworks(strategy, task, context)

## Common LLM-Driven Patterns

### 1. Multi-Step Reasoning Chain
Each agent follows a structured reasoning chain:
1. **Analyze** the task and context
2. **Plan** the optimal approach
3. **Select** appropriate methods/tools
4. **Execute** with intelligent adaptation
5. **Synthesize** results into insights
6. **Recommend** next steps

### 2. Adaptive Execution
Agents can:
- Stop early if goals are met
- Retry with different approaches on failure
- Escalate complex decisions
- Learn from previous results

### 3. Context-Aware Decision Making
All decisions consider:
- Task requirements and constraints
- Available resources and capabilities
- Previous agent results
- Business context and priorities
- Risk and compliance factors

### 4. Fallback Mechanisms
When LLM calls fail, agents have intelligent fallbacks:
- Use heuristic-based decisions
- Apply conservative approaches
- Provide clear error explanations
- Maintain system reliability

## Benefits of LLM-Based Architecture

### 1. True Intelligence
- Agents reason about problems rather than just executing code
- Context-aware decision making
- Adaptive problem-solving strategies

### 2. Flexibility
- No hardcoded assumptions about data sources or methods
- Easily extensible with new capabilities
- Adapts to changing requirements

### 3. Explainability
- Clear reasoning chains for all decisions
- Confidence levels and uncertainty handling
- Audit trails for compliance

### 4. Scalability
- New tools/methods can be added without code changes
- Agents automatically discover and utilize new capabilities
- Self-improving through experience

## Configuration and Extensibility

### Adding New Data Sources
Instead of code changes, simply update `mcp_config.json`:
```json
{
  "new_data_source": {
    "command": "python",
    "args": ["new_source_server.py"],
    "env": {
      "DATA_SOURCE_URL": "https://api.newsource.com"
    }
  }
}
```

The DataAgent will automatically:
1. Discover the new source
2. Analyze its capabilities
3. Include it in tool selection decisions

### Adding New Security Frameworks
Update EntitlementAgent's framework definitions, and it will:
1. Automatically consider the new framework
2. Reason about its applicability
3. Generate appropriate recommendations

### Adding New Analysis Methods
Update AggregationAgent's framework definitions, and it will:
1. Consider new analytical approaches
2. Select them when appropriate
3. Integrate results intelligently

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Learning and Memory
- Agents remember successful strategies
- Learn from user feedback
- Improve decision-making over time

### 2. Multi-Agent Collaboration
- Agents can request help from other agents
- Collaborative problem-solving
- Shared knowledge base

### 3. Advanced Reasoning
- Chain-of-thought reasoning
- Multi-step planning
- Hypothesis testing and validation

## Conclusion

This LLM-based architecture transforms our system from a collection of tools into a team of intelligent agents. Each agent:

- **Thinks** before acting
- **Plans** optimal strategies
- **Adapts** to changing conditions
- **Learns** from experience
- **Explains** its reasoning

This creates a system that is not just more powerful, but more trustworthy, flexible, and aligned with human reasoning patterns.
